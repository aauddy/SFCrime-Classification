San Francisco is the most sought after place in every aspect. It is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. Also known as the silicon valley- the hub of new technology and start ups, which has drawn many techies worldwide.
However, San francisco has many dingy places having homeless people, the air smells of weed and infamous for crimes. 

So here we will be dealing with a crime dataset - having incidents derived from SFPD Crime Incident Reporting system. Out=r goal is to categorize the future crimes.
The data ranges from year 2003 till 2015. It was provided in one of the Kaggle competition. The goal is to categorize the future crime.
The training data has the data belonging to odd number of weeks i.e. 1 ,3,5.... Whereas the test dataset contains even numbered 
weeks i.e. 2,4,6....

It is to be noted that the data for year 2015 is partial i.e. we have data till the month of May.

We are given the following data fields:
